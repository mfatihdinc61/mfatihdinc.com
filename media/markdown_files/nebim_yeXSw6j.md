## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The aim of the project was to develop an **affordable universal testing system** that performs:

- **Tensile testing**
- **Hardness testing**
- **Bending testing**

Unlike traditional machines, our system uses **image processing techniques** to extract mechanical behavior and measurements, eliminating the need for **expensive measurement equipment** such as extensometers, strain gauges, or force sensors.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- âœ… **Low-cost testing system** using vision-based measurement
- âœ… All algorithms implemented in **MATLAB**
- âœ… Tests conducted on custom-built mechanical rig with camera-based feedback
- âœ… Modular code and adaptable to different material testing scenarios

## ðŸ‘¥ Team

This project was developed by a team of six final-year Mechanical Engineering students from METU as part of their graduation requirement, image processing part of the project was designed by the owner of this Repo. Project was displayed to the jury in **February 2022**
